# AVR_P
I connected two devices using an AVR microcontroller, the first is a clock module and the second is an LFM 75 temperature sensor. There are two push buttons on the chip itself to set the clock. In parentheses, I would like to say that I set the clock to 11:18 Iran time. Now, if you like, you can change it.
